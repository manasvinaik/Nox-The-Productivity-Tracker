# Nox-The-Productivity-Tracker

NOX is a Task Manager to organize daily tasks while also keeping in mind your
mental health. NOX is characterized by a pixelated
ghost sprite and related games and animations.

This project was designed to help the user keep track of their daily assignments
and to help them relax when those assignments are done. The project provides
a task manager, a game for relaxation and a mental health corner to listen to
music and center themselves. The project is in a gamified format which makes
the interface appealing to the user.
